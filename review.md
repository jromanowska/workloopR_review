## Package Review

*Please check off boxes as applicable, and elaborate in comments below.  Your review is not limited to these topics, as described in the reviewer guide*

- [x] As the reviewer I confirm that there are no [conflicts of interest](#coi) for me to review this work (If you are unsure whether you are in conflict, please speak to your editor _before_ starting your review).

#### Documentation

The package includes all the following forms of documentation:

- [x] **A statement of need** clearly stating problems the software is designed to solve and its target audience in README
- [ ] **Installation instructions:** for the development version of package and any non-standard dependencies in README
    * The installation instruction could be expanded to point out that the default command to install from github will __not__ create vignettes. While this may not be needed for all the users, I was a bit sceptic when I wanted to view the vignettes, as instructed in README.
- [x] **Vignette(s)** demonstrating major functionality that runs successfully locally
    * Very good vignettes. Two comments from me:
      + could the authors include links to the vignettes in README, where they refer to those?
      + please, order the vignettes differently, so as to at least include "Intro..." as the first one.
- [x] **Function Documentation:** for all exported functions in R help
- [x] **Examples** for all exported functions in R Help that run successfully locally
- [x] **Community guidelines** including contribution guidelines in the README or CONTRIBUTING, and DESCRIPTION with `URL`, `BugReports` and `Maintainer` (which may be autogenerated via `Authors@R`).

##### For packages co-submitting to JOSS

- [x] The package has an **obvious research application** according to [JOSS's definition](http://joss.theoj.org/about#submission_requirements)

The package contains a `paper.md` matching [JOSS's requirements](http://joss.theoj.org/about#paper_structure) with:

- [x] **A short summary** describing the high-level functionality of the software
- [x] **Authors:**  A list of authors with their affiliations
- [x] **A statement of need** clearly stating problems the software is designed to solve and its target audience.
- [x] **References:** with DOIs for all those that have one (e.g. papers, datasets, software).

#### Functionality

- [x] **Installation:** Installation succeeds as documented.
- [x] **Functionality:** Any functional claims of the software been confirmed.
- [ ] **Performance:** Any performance claims of the software been confirmed.
    * There were no performance claims.
- [x] **Automated tests:** Unit tests cover essential functions of the package
   and a reasonable range of inputs and conditions. All tests pass on the local machine.
- [ ] **Packaging guidelines**: The package conforms to the rOpenSci packaging guidelines
    * wrong use of `cat` in `data_import_functions.R` (this should be `message`)
    * README does not contain a list of vignettes, nor it has links to the vignettes
    * Documentation: nicely created with pkgdown; I would create groups for listing the functions in Reference

#### Final approval (post-review)

- [ ] **The author has responded to my review and made changes to my satisfaction. I recommend approving this package.**

### Review Comments

It is a very nice package, with a clear aim, providing specific functions for analysis of data from muscle physiology experiments. Even though I am not within the field, I could easily understand what it does and how to use it. The README is very instructive, nicely written, with clear figures and fantastic workflow scheme to help explain what's going on in the package. Very good!

In general, the authors made a very good job in structuring the code, commenting, creating documentation and testing. However, I have few comments and suggestions:

* is it necessary to have to install all the packages that are listed in vignettes? It takes a lot of time when creating those during the installation of the package.
* in the vignette "Plotting data in workloopR", please delete the `vnudge` parameter in the last command, as it produces a warning.
* why do the authors comment out some commands in the "examples" sections? Couldn't the "dontrun" command be used?
* I would suggest to split the code into more files --- right now, there are three .R files with all the functions, which can be a bit difficult to read and maintain, especially if someone else would like to contribute
* please check that you use `return` command within each function to explicitly state what is the output of those
* `read_wl.ddf` and `read_twitch.ddf` mix the naming conventions --- I would suggest rather `read_wl_ddf` and `read_twitch_ddf`
* running `spelling::spell_check_package()` on the package showed that perhaps the authors should change "filetype", "filepath" to "file type" and "file path", respectively
* running `goodpractice::gp()` showed that there three things the authors should consider correcting:
  * too long lines in some of the functions
  * using both, "<-" and "=" is discouraged
  * change `sapply` to `vapply`, change `1:length()` to `seq_along`

Check also the [output](https://jromanowska.github.io/workloopR_review/) generated with the `pkgreviewr` for details on testing and automated checks.
